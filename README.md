## Problem Description and Motivation

### Problem Description
Mud in water pipelines poses significant problems for households, businesses, and industries by causing clogged pipes, decreased water pressure, and contamination. This project aims to develop a tool that detects mud in water pipelines, diverts contaminated water, and ensures a safe water supply. The tool is also intended to assist industries in harsh environments such as mining and quarrying.

### Motivation
The motivation for the Turbi Detector project stems from the widespread issue of water contamination due to mud, which impacts various sectors and everyday life. By creating a reliable and efficient detection system, we aim to improve water quality and pipeline maintenance, ultimately contributing to better public health and industrial operations.

## Technical Feasibility
The Turbi Detector uses an infrared sensor to detect mud in water. The sensor emits a beam of light through the water, and changes in light intensity caused by mud particles trigger an alert to the control system. The system includes continuous water quality monitoring capabilities using an ESP 8266 12e and a notification system to inform users of persistent issues via a mobile app.

### Key Components
- **Infrared Sensor**: Detects mud particles by measuring changes in light intensity.
